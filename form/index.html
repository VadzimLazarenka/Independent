        <h1>Empire State Building</h1>
        <div class="last-div">
            <p>The Empire State Building is a 102-story skyscraper located in New York on Manhattan Island, on Fifth Avenue between West 33rd and 34th streets. It is an office building. From 1931 to 1970, before the opening of the North Tower of the World Trade Center, it was the tallest building in the world. In 2001, when the WTC towers collapsed, the skyscraper again became the tallest building in New York (until 2012, when the World Trade Center 1, which was under construction, became taller). It is currently the third tallest skyscraper in the United States, behind the Freedom Tower in New York and the Willis Tower in Chicago, and the 51st tallest in the world. The architecture of the building belongs to the Art Deco style.

                In 1986, the Empire State Building was included in the list of national historic monuments of the United States, and in 2007 at number one - in the list of the best American architectural achievements, according to the American Institute of Architects. The building is owned and operated by the Empire State Realty Trust and is currently undergoing a $550 million renovation, $120 million of which is for energy reduction.</p>
